                    <p>
                        Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight
                        into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed
                        his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo
                        suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.

                    <h2>The Mission</h2>

                    <p>
                        The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the<strong> Atlantic Missile Range</strong> at Cape
                        Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310
                        miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape
                        Canaveral.

                    <h6>True Fact from Wiki</h6>

                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordo_(monkey)">
                        Gordo was one of the first monkeys to travel into space. As part of the NASA space program, Gordo, also known as Old
                        Reliable, was launched from Cape Canaveral on December 13, 1958, in the U.S. PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on its AM-13
                        mission. The rocket would travel over 1,500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth
                        and landing in the South Atlantic. A technical malfunction prevented the capsule's parachute from opening and,
                        despite a short search, neither his body nor the vessel were ever recovered.

                    <p>
                        The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range
                        successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political
                        reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.

                    <p>
                        Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted
                        with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey,
                        considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.<strong
